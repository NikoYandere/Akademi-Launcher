# Akademi Launcher (a.k.a YLWE - Yanix Launcher Windows Edition)
This launcher is an unofficial tool, not supported or created by YandereDev. It was developed by NikoYandere as an alternative to the official launcher. If you are looking to use this launcher on Linux, there is a dedicated Linux version available [here](https://github.com/NikoYandere/yanix-launcher) ,though please be aware that the Linux and Windows versions may not be identical in all aspects, as the Windows edition is still a work in progress.

While the Akademi Launcher aims to provide an easy and efficient way to launch Yandere Simulator, it is still in development and may undergo significant changes. Users may experience some differences in features or functionality compared to the Linux version, as the development focus is primarily on the Linux platform at the moment.

This project is open-source, meaning anyone can contribute or suggest improvements. It is important to note that this launcher does not have official backing from YandereDev or the Yandere Simulator team, so it may not receive regular updates or support. The goal is to provide a better experience for players who have issues with the official launcher or prefer an alternative method of launching the game.

If you encounter any bugs or have feedback, feel free to share your thoughts with the development team. Since the project is still evolving, your input could help shape the future of the launcher.
